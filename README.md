# myq-garage
Python Chamberlain Garage Door interface

Python used to interface with my MyQ garage doors. 
Load it as a module, or download it and run directly.

1. Download myq-garage.py to your device. Or use git ("git clone https://github.com/Einstein42/myq-garage.git")
2. Put it in the same folder as your relay server if using any of io_guy's products.
3. chmod 755 myq-garage.py
4. Edit the file and put your myq username and password. Including ISY information if applicable.

Then use like so:
Command Line options:  ./myq-garage.py [open/close/status] [door name]
Door name is the name you set in the MyQ webpage for the device. If you don't know your door name, 
then just ./myq-garage.py status and it will return the doornames and status from the MyQ portal. 

Requires the requests package in python
1. apt-get install python-requests
OR
2. apt-get install python-pip
3. pip install requests

Updated to work fully with Python2.7 or Python3.

DONT FORGET TO CREATE YOUR STATE VARIABLES IN THE ISY, it will tell you if you forgot.
There isn't currently a way to create these via API, I will update as soon as ISY allows state variable creation.

Variable format is the setting from myq-garage.py "ISY_VAR_PREFIX + your door name. 
Substitute any spaces with '_' as ISY doesn't allow spaces in variable names.
eg. 'Big Door' is my door name in MyQ and my variable prefix is MyQ_ so I create the variable MyQ_Big_Door

Variable is set to 1 when open, 0 when closed.

If you want to run this so it updates your state variables in ISY automatically every 5 minutes
you can add a crontab entry on your linux/raspbian like so:

1. crontab -e
2. new line at the botton
3. */5 * * * * /path/to/myq-garage.py status

I wouldn't recommend doing more than every 5 minutes as the Chamberlain MyQ API is 'unofficial' therefore if we 
take down their servers from flooding them with requests, I doubt the'd be happy.

Cheers - E
